üìß blancr1@uci.edu | üîó [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blanca-romero-mila) | üìö [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S2IpQDgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)

I'm a Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. candidate at the [University of California, Irvine](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/bme), under the guidance of [Dr. Beth Lopour](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/beth-lopour) at the [Laboratory of Computational and Translational Neuroscience](https://lopour.eng.uci.edu/). My current research focuses on using computational techniques to study information processing in the human brain and neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Specifically, I am working on **time-frequency machine learning methods** to more precisely **delineate brain regions generating seizure activity**. I have also worked with [Dr. William La Cava](https://cavalab.org/) during an internship at the [Computational Health Informatics Program, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School](https://www.chip.org/), where we analyzed **implicit bias in emergency department triage scoring**.
